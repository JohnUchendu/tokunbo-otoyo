          Important Telecommunication law ensures fair competition, protects
          consumer rights, and regulates licensing and spectrum use. It plays a
          key role in national security, emergency services, and the development
          of digital infrastructure. With telecom being the backbone of modern
          communication and commerce, clear legal frameworks are essential for
          innovation, investment, and connectivity.
